# Energy Monitor

## Description
#### A dashboard for the monitoring of energy metrics and such as price, demand, or carbon production. See how much of your electricity is generated by nuclear fission, check the cheapest time to charge your electric campervan, or just have a curious glance at what's going on in the grid we all depend upon.

(Python 3.12> and MacOS. You will need Amazon AWS and your login credentials.)

## 'Visuals'
! We'll add some visuals here maybe, using [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) or using [ttygif](https://github.com/icholy/ttygif) and a recording. !

## Installation
[Clone the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) from github.

In terminal, navigate to the root directory of the repository `energy_monitor`.
Run the following commands:
- `python3 -m venv .venv`
- `bash setup.sh` ! we might want a simple setup script !
- `source .venv/bin/activate`
- `pip3 install requirements.txt`

Once you have done this, you should be able to run Energy Monitor by running `python3 run.py` from within the repository. No need to run the other steps again.

! definitely a demo here using [Asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) ! 

## Data Sources & Design Choices

Energy production, demand, and cost data is sources from [Elexions](https://bmrs.elexon.co.uk/remit). Carbon tracking data is taken from [carbon_intensity.org](https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/). 

Our Extract, Transform, Load [ETL] pipleine works in the following way; firstly, **E**xtract scripts for each API endpoint run regularly on Amazon Web Service [AWS] Lambdas requesting the latest data. Lambdas are quick to fire up and shut down, making them the ideal choice to quickly execute lightweight, intermittent tasks. This fresh data is then transferred to an AWS 's3 bucket', offering a quick and cost-effective storage. Some modest data curation is done by a **T**ransform script, and a **L**oad script loads the clean data into a PostGres SQL database on the AWS. For a full-scale and not a proof-of-concept project, we would ideally use an Amazon RedShift database which better supports read-heavy operations. In our limited instance, the inexpensive PostGres database is the best solution.

Another script runs our [StreamLit](https://streamlit.io) dashboard. StreamLit is an open-source dashboard solution that is easy to work with and lightweight to run. The dashboard, running perpetually as a service on an EC2 instance, reads data from our database and plots it in a pleasing set of graphs.

## Road Map

Where could we go next?

Elexon offers a lot more data that we could integrate, and energy suppliers like Octopus offer detailed insight which might allow users to add their personal energy usage to the dashboard.
