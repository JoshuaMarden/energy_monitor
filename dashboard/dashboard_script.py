- **BIOMASS**: Organic materials used as a renewable energy source. It includes plant materials and animal waste that can be burned or converted to biofuels.
- **CCGT (Combined Cycle Gas Turbine)**: A form of highly efficient energy generation that combines a gas-fired turbine with a steam turbine. 
- **COAL**: Traditional fossil fuel used for generating electricity through combustion.
- **NPSHYD (Non-Pumped Storage Hydro)**: Refers to the conventional hydroelectric generation where water flows through turbines to generate power, with no pumped storage components.
- **NUCLEAR**: Power generated using nuclear reactions.Provides a stable base-load energy supply.
- **OCGT (Open Cycle Gas Turbine)**: A type of gas power plant where air is compressed, mixed with fuel, and burned in a simple cycle. It's less efficient than CCGT but is often quicker to start and stop.
- **OIL**: Oil-fired power plants burn petroleum or its derivatives to generate electricity. Similar to coal, it has large environmental impacts. 
- **OTHER**: This category usually encompasses any generation sources not specifically listed, which could include experimental or less common technologies like tidal or certain types of bio-gas plants.
- **PS (Pumped Storage)**: A type of hydropower generation where water is pumped to a higher elevation during low demand periods and released through turbines for electricity during high demand.
- **WIND**: The use of wind turbines to convert wind energy into electricity. It's a clean, renewable source increasingly used worldwide, particularly in areas with strong, consistent winds.
